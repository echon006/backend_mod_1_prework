## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
a. Practice SMART, Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals
b. Seek challenges

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
Having more of a process like following the SMART process.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
Hash is a collection of variables regarding an object.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {
  dog_food_bags: 54
  cat_food_bags: 37
}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
puts states[:CO]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
p states.keys
p states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
an array is a list/collection of objects, while a hash is a collection of variables.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
